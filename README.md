# Project-One

Project One is my first "proper" attempt at creating (and completing) a generic 2D Platformer game made in Unity [C#], using my own assets. This is also my first foray into Pixel Art using Aseprite, and yes - my sprites are... very bad. Lastly, I am using Bosca Ceoil for the music and sfx.
